# Personalized surf app

Personalized surf reports based on swell, wind, tide, location, skill level, and availability.

## Current state

Returns whether El Porto is small and not blown out. Sends me a text every night with wave conditions if the surf looks good at sunrise the next morning or a message explaining why the surf conditions are forecasted to be poor.

## Future work

* Pull and filter based on tide.
* Pull daily sunrise time. Currently hardcoded to 6am Pacific.
* Return forecast for one week instead of daily.
* Extend to multiple surf spots.
* Create frontend for entering user preferences.
* Create backend database for saving and updating user preferences.
* Add water quality check.
